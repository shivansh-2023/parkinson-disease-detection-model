## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivansh-2023/parkinson-disease-detection-model.git
cd parkinson-disease-detection-model
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Organize your spiral and wave image datasets in the following structure:
```
data/
├── spiral/
│   ├── healthy/
│   └── parkinson/
└── wave/
    ├── healthy/
    └── parkinson/
```

2. Prepare your clinical data CSV file with columns matching the ones specified in `config.py`.

3. Generate synthetic data for improved training:
```bash
python enhanced_data_generator.py --samples 500 --output_dir data/enhanced_synthetic_data
```

### Training

Train a specific model or all models:

```bash
# Train all models
python train.py --train_all

# Train a specific model
python train.py --model cnn
python train.py --model rf
python train.py --model svm
python train.py --model gb
python train.py --model transfer_vgg16
python train.py --model transfer_resnet50

# Train an enhanced model
python enhanced_train.py --model_type enhanced_cnn --epochs 30
python enhanced_train.py --model_type mobilenet --epochs 30
python enhanced_train.py --model_type efficientnet --epochs 30
python enhanced_train.py --model_type ensemble --epochs 30
```

Additional training options:
```bash
python enhanced_train.py --model_type enhanced_cnn --epochs 30 --augment True --batch_size 32
```

### Prediction

#### Command-Line Interface

Predict using a specific model:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path test_spiral.jpg --model cnn
python predict.py --image_path test_wave.jpg --model ensemble
```

#### Web Interface

Launch the interactive web interface:

```bash
python predict.py --web_interface
```

This will start a local Gradio server where you can upload images and see predictions in real-time.

## Diagnostic Tools

The project includes comprehensive diagnostic tools to evaluate model performance:

### Diagnostic Application (GUI)

Run the diagnostic application to compare model predictions and test with various patterns:

```bash
python diagnostic_app.py
```

Features:
- Compare predictions from different model variants
- Test models on synthetic patterns (empty image, spiral, wave, random noise)
- Visualize prediction confidence and raw values
- Upload and test custom images

### Test Model Predictions

Test how the model performs on different types of inputs:

```bash
python test_model_predictions.py --model enhanced_cnn
```

## Enhanced Models

The project now includes improved model architectures:

1. **Enhanced CNN:** Deeper architecture with optimized layers for better feature extraction
2. **MobileNet:** Lightweight model adapted for spiral and wave pattern recognition
3. **EfficientNet:** High-performance model with optimized architecture
4. **Ensemble Model:** Combines predictions from multiple model architectures

## Model Performance

The system is designed to achieve over 85% accuracy in detecting Parkinson's disease. The ensemble model combines predictions from all individual models for improved performance.
